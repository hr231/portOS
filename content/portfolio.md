# Harshit B. — Portfolio

## About

Harshit B. is an AI Engineer and ML Systems builder based in Boston, MA. He is pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University (GPA: 3.9/4.0, expected December 2026). He holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from LDRP Institute of Technology and Research, Gandhinagar, India (GPA: 3.3/4.0, May 2024).

He builds production ML systems — agentic AI platforms, temporal risk models, real-time voice agents, and scalable data pipelines. He cares about systems that work at scale, not just in notebooks.

## Work Experience

### AI Engineer Intern — Staples Inc. (Jan 2026 – Present, Framingham, MA)

- Spearheaded production-grade LLM applications automating high-labor workflows, reducing manual effort by 40% and error rates across enterprise retail operations.
- Constructed LangGraph-based inference pipelines with FastAPI, GraphQL, and gRPC integrations for real-time reasoning and retrieval over PGVector and Neo4j.
- Integrated OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and vLLM backends through unified connector APIs, enabling rapid experimentation and model portability.
- Optimized Kubernetes-deployed vLLM clusters for low latency and high throughput via dynamic batching, quantization, and GPU utilization tuning.

### ML Engineer Intern — Pixeltechnologies (Jan – Jul 2024, Remote)

- Architected Python-based prediction pipelines using scikit-learn and XGBoost to forecast ad engagement on 100K+ events; enhanced campaign ROI by 22%.
- Engineered SQL-driven ETL and Airflow DAGs to process high-velocity A/B test logs; cut model retraining latency by 40%.
- Operationalized ML explainability by deploying interpretable models with SHAP values; uncovered 3 key vulnerabilities and improved accuracy by 18%.

### Data Analyst Intern — GROWITUP (Jul 2023 – Jan 2024, Remote)

- Pioneered a vectorized search system using OpenAI embeddings and FastAPI, achieving 96% faster retrieval across 5K+ documents.
- Modeled user sessions with Snowflake and PostgreSQL to detect behavioral anomalies and data drift patterns.

## Projects

### FrontShiftAI: Multi-Tenant Agentic Platform (Sept 2025)
Technologies: FastAPI, Airflow, ChromaDB, Modal, LiveKit, React

- Designed a Unified Agent Router in FastAPI using regex-based intent detection with LLM fallback to intelligently route requests between deterministic SQL agents and probabilistic LLaMA-3 RAG pipelines.
- Automated Airflow 3.0 ETL pipelines utilizing a dedicated SmolVLM Vision Microservice to ingest unstructured PDF data, validating quality via Great Expectations before embedding into vector databases.
- Implemented Hybrid Search (BM25 + Vector) with Cross-Encoder Reranking, significantly reducing hallucination rates for policy queries.
- Deployed a serverless voice agent on Modal via LiveKit WebRTC for bi-directional real-time audio interactions.

### Credit Risk Forecasting via Temporal Architectures (Apr 2025)
Technologies: TensorFlow, SHAP, Azure CI/CD, SQL

- Segmented 30K+ financial transactions into lag-aware bins and extracted temporal features to surface default patterns.
- Trained Bi-LSTM and TabTransformer models for risk classification; boosted minority F1-score by 16% achieving 81.9% accuracy.
- Visualized temporal risk triggers using SHAP plots to improve auditor interpretability and model trust.
- Azure DevOps CI/CD pipelines for reproducible deployment.

### GEMTREK: Diamond Manufacturing Analytics System (Dec 2024)
Technologies: SQL, Python, Power BI, Snowflake, Azure

- Optimized Snowflake ETL pipelines (35% faster processing).
- Python analytics on 100K+ records for diamond manufacturing operations.
- Real-time Power BI dashboards via REST API — 40% better operational transparency.
