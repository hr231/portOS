He is pursuing a Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering at Northeastern University (GPA: 3.9/4.0, expected December 2026). He holds a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from LDRP Institute of Technology and Research, Gandhinagar, India (GPA: 3.3/4.0, May 2024).\n\nHe builds production ML systems — agentic AI platforms, temporal risk models, real-time voice agents, and scalable data pipelines. He cares about systems that work at scale, not just in notebooks.\n\nContact: brahmbhatt.h@northeastern.edu | 857-565-4643 | Boston, MA | LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/harshitb1611\n\n## Certifications\n\n- Stanford Machine Learning\n- DeepLearning.AI Generative AI\n- UPenn Quantitative Modeling\n\n---\n\n## Work Experience\n\n### AI Engineer Intern — Staples Inc.
